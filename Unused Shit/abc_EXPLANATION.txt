This is just to explain everything


TEXTURES:

Block: was meant to set a switch to open the door but I couldn't figure out how to make it work
Switch: used for block
Coin: was just a coin. It did nothing and it wasn't used for anything useful
Door: just a door to go to the bonus room
Saw: meant to kill the player and reset room, but I couldn't make it work before the deadline

ROOMS:


Bonus_RM: was just a bonus room filled with coins. Doesn't work because the door fucked up the level switching mechanic.
Coin.tscn: just something so I wouldn't have to copy and paste the coin object over and over again.
ROOM5_2: Second version of the room. It's the same as the original now because ROOM5_1 was meant for before you entered Bonus_RM

CODE:


GLobal: was used for the switch & block mechanic but was never actually used.
