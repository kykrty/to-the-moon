bg1, 2, and 3: All of them use images from the Wikimedia Commons. I had to check if I could use them and they were all under creative commons

Tileset: The tileset was made by HeartBeat. Here's their channel. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrHQNOyU1q6BFEfkNq2CYMA
Most of the code: Most of the code was made from a tutorial by, again, HeartBeat.

Everything else was made by me.
